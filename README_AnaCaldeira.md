0) Project "Unbabel java-coding-challenge" was implemented in java, using Eclipse IDE.

1) Folder java-coding-challenge contains java project of the exercise requested. You can import it to your IDE directly (e.g. using Eclipse: Import -> General -> Existing project into workspace). Maven should take care of all dependencies.

2) Zip java-coding-challenge contains the same project, in archive mode.
You can import it to your IDE directly (e.g. using Eclipse: Import -> General -> Project from Folder or Archive -> Archive). Maven should take care of all dependencies.

3) Folder Application Techinical Scope contains projects documentation and class diagram.

4) Jar java-coding-challenge-executable is an executable jar of the project. You should be able to move it to whatever folder you desire and to open it just by double clicking. If by any reason it doesn't open, try it on Command Prompt by:
	-> going to its directory: > cd [directory]
	-> executing: > java -jar java-coding-challenge-executable.jar


NOTES: I didn't had enought time to finish the exercise as intended. I did junit tests and compreensive documentation comments to class TranslationRequest as an example of the approach I would take.
